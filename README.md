Inspired by the following problem posed on the phillydev slack by [@TomFrost](https://github.com/TomFrost):

> I've placed rocks on the ground, in a straight line. The rocks are all different sizes. I know how tall they are. I've laid an infinitely long ruler next to them, so I know the distances between any two rocks. The rocks cannot move or crumble.
> I turn my back to this setup, and someone places a wooden plank on top of my rocks. They tell me, on the ruler, where the edges of the plank are. My job is to tell them the slope of the plank. Remember the y=mx+b formula from grade school math? I need m (the angle) and b (the height).
